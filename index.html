    <p>CSS stands for cascading stylesheet it is where you put in code using an open and close braket where you types the tag. In there you can add the background color, highlight, color, color of the words, and font-family, what type of font it is typed in. Internal CSS is where you add the rule set in the head of the code, between the head opening and closing tag, there you can choose which tag you want to add style to. Inline CSS is where you add the rule set in the line of the tag between the open and close angle bracket but after the words in the tag. External CSS is where you put the rule set into another file that is connected to the index using the link tag. In this sheet you put the tags you want to edit and add the rule set in an open and close bracket. The major differences of these CSS code is where you put the rule set.</p>
